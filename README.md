# Insider Attack Detection

## Overview

### Insider Attack Definition
Insider attacks refer to malicious actions taken by authorized users within an organization that can result in significant damage. These attacks can involve theft of intellectual property, sabotage, exposure of sensitive data, and even attacks on web applications. Such threats are particularly dangerous because the attacker already has access to the internal systems, making detection more challenging.

## Dataset

This project utilizes the **Insider Threat Test Dataset**, which is publicly available from Carnegie Mellon University. The dataset includes both background data and synthetic data of malicious actors to simulate various insider attack scenarios. It provides valuable insights for understanding patterns of anomalous behavior and is essential for developing detection systems for insider threats.

You can access the dataset [here](https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/dataset/Insider_Threat_Test_Dataset/12841247).

### Dataset Features:
- **Synthetic Data:** The dataset includes synthetic data representing both normal system behavior (background) and malicious actions performed by an insider actor.
- **Anomaly Detection:** It provides a basis for anomaly detection research, as the data includes events typical of insider threats such as unauthorized access or suspicious behavior patterns.
- **Realistic Simulation:** The dataset simulates realistic insider threat scenarios to help develop and test detection algorithms.

## Solution Approach

The dataset was used to train and validate anomaly detection models aimed at identifying insider attacks. Given the complexity and the variety of insider threats, **machine learning algorithms** were employed as the solution to automatically detect suspicious activities. For this project, **Python** was used for data manipulation and machine learning model development.

### Machine Learning Algorithm:
A machine learning algorithm was chosen to model normal user behavior and identify deviations that may indicate malicious actions. The model was trained on both normal and malicious event data, learning to distinguish between typical and anomalous activities. This helps in the early detection of potential insider threats before they can cause significant damage.

## Conclusion

By utilizing the **Insider Threat Test Dataset** and applying machine learning techniques in **Python**, this project aims to enhance the ability to detect and mitigate insider threats. The goal is to create a system that can recognize abnormal behavior patterns and alert security teams to possible risks from within the organization.
